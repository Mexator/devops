# Kube prometheus

## Kube prometheus stack components

* **Prometheus** time series database. Usually used to store metrics and
retrieve them with powerful query language.
* **node_exporter** is an agent that collects metrics from nodes, in our case pods.
* **Grafana** software that can build beautiful plots and dashboards provided with data.
* **Alertmanager** software that can create and deliver alert notifications from Prometheus data.
* **Kube-state-metrics** gather metrics from Kubernetes cluster.
* **Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs** Not sure about this.
    Seemingly it just connects together prometheus and Kube-state-metrics.
* **Prometheus-operator** Allows configuring Prometheus via native way for Kubernetes: declarative yml files.

The command prints all Kubernetes object of types: `pod`, `statefulset`, `service`, `persistentvolumeclaim`, `configmap`.

When the chart was installed, one can use `kubectl port-forward [pod] 3000`,
as described
[here](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus#access-the-dashboards).

1. StatefulSet consumes 0.0176 Gb of memory and <1% of CPU

2. It is hard to say which pod uses least CPU, but it is clearly visible that
prometheus pod uses the most

3. Around 60% of RAM is used in node, namely 1.65Gb is available out of 3.9 total.

5. Prometheus uses network the most, and clock-apps the least

6. I got 8 alerts
